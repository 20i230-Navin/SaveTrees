                    <h1>What Is Deforestation?</h1>
                    <p>Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate,
                         natural, or accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life, but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.</p>
                    <p>
                        The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Deforestation occurs for a number of reasons, including farming, with 80% of deforestation resulting from extensive cattle ranching, and logging for materials and development. It has been happening for thousands of years, arguably since man began converting from hunter/gatherer to agricultural based societies, and required larger, unobstructed tracks of land to accommodate cattle, crops, and housing. It was only after the onset of the modern era that it became an epidemic.</p>

                    <h1>The Causes of Deforestation: Why Is Deforestation Happening?</h1>
                    <p>Multiple factors, either of human or natural origin, cause deforestation. Natural factors include natural forest fires or parasite-caused diseases which can result in deforestation. Nevertheless, human activities are among the main causes of global deforestation.</p>
                    <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the expansion of agriculture caused nearly 80% of global deforestation, with the construction of infrastructures such as roads or dams, together with mining activities and urbanization, making up the remaining causes of deforestation.</p>

                    <h3>1. Agriculture is the Number 1 Cause of Deforestation (~80%)</h3>
                    <p>Why is deforestation happening? According to the FAO, agriculture causes around 80% of deforestation. And how does agriculture cause so much deforestation? According to the same report, 33% of agriculture-caused deforestation is a consequence of subsistence agriculture – such as local peasant agriculture in developing countries.</p>
                    <p>Commercial or industrial agriculture (field crops and livestock) cause around 40% of forest loss – in the search for space to grow food, fibers or biofuel (such as soybeans, palm oil, beef, rice, maize, cotton and sugar cane). It is also particularly interesting to note livestock is believed to be responsible for about 14% of global deforestation. The main reasons why have to do with the large areas require both to raise livestock but also to grow its (soy-based) food.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-right causes_content_right">
                    <h3>2. Deforestation Caused By New Constructions (~15%)</h3>
                    <p>The construction of human infrastructures has also been driving deforestation. More specifically, 10% of deforestation can be attributed to new infrastructures that serve the current human lifestyle in four main ways: transportation, transformation and energy generation.</p>
                    <p>On one hand, roads, rails, ports or airports have been built to move all sorts of goods – from cereals and fruits to spices, minerals or fossil fuels – either directly to trade centers or to transformation sites. So while at first there were only fruit trees, roads soon arrived to allow transporting fruit to other regions. And while some goods were and are collected manually, others such as coal, oil, natural gas, biomass, but also meat, dairy or spirits, required the construction of large extraction, transportation and/or transformation infrastructures.</p>

                    <h3>3. How Urbanization Is Causing Deforestation (~5%)</h3>
                     <p>The populational shift that is leading people to move from rural areas to urban areas is also contributing to deforestation (5%, according to FAO). This urban growth – in which 68% of the world’s population is expected to live in cities by 2050 – is leading to an exponential growth of housing and consumption sites. And as cities become larger so they can host more people, they challenge the natural boundaries surrounding them, often leading to deforestation. This is one of the reasons why deforestation is happening.</p>

                    <h1>Environmental Effects of Deforestation From Above</h1>
                    <h3>Loss of Habitat</h3>
                    <p>One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.</p>
                    <p>The trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. Deforestation results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.</p>

                    <h3>Increased Greenhouse Gases</h3>
                    <p>In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose that ability and release more carbon.</p>

                    <h3>Water in the Atmosphere</h3>
                    <p>The trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to regulate the water cycle. In deforested areas, there is less water in the air to be returned to the soil. This then causes dryer soil and the inability to grow crops.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-right effect_content_right">
                    <h1>Environmental Effects of Deforestation From Below</h1>
                    <h3>Soil Erosion and Flooding</h3>
                    <p>Further effects of deforestation include soil erosion and coastal flooding. Trees help the land to retain water and topsoil, which provides the rich nutrients to sustain additional forest life.</p>
                    <p>Without forests, the soil erodes and washes away, causing farmers to move on and perpetuate the cycle. The barren land which is left behind in the wake of these unsustainable agricultural practices is then more susceptible to flooding, specifically in coastal regions.</p>

                    <h1>Effects of Deforestation on Indigenous People</h1>
                    <h3>Destruction of Homelands</h3>
                    <p>As large amounts of forests are cleared away, allowing exposed earth to whither and die and the habitats of innumerable species to be destroyed, the indigenous communities who live there and depend on the forest to sustain their way of life are also under threat.</p>
                    <p>The loss of forests has an immediate and direct effect on their lifestyle that we in the highly industrialized parts of the world, despite our own dependency on what the rainforest provides, will never know. The level of immediacy is exponentially greater for indigenous peoples.</p>
                    <p>The governments of nations with rainforests in their borders often attempt to evict indigenous tribes before the actual clear-cutting begins. This is one of the pre-emptive effects of deforestation.</p>

            <h1>preventions</h1>
            <div>
                <h3>1.Plant a tree</h3>
                <p>The most straightforward personal strategy to fight against deforestation is to plant a tree. Planting a tree could be considered a lifelong investment into the environment and your good mental health.
                    The cutting down of trees causes billions of tons of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to be released into the air. By planting trees, you are helping to combat global warming because trees absorb carbon dioxide</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2.Use less paper</h3>
                <p>Two million trees are cut every day just to supply the paper demand of the United States.</p>
                <p>Globally, 40 percent of all timber is used to make paper products, and the demand for paper increases by two to three percent every year. This means that the paper industry is still consuming more and more trees.</p>
                <p>Since the industry has such a high need for wood, it should come as no surprise that some part of the timber originates from illegal logging.</p>
                <p>More than 30 percent of wood used by paper mills in Indonesia, one of the major paper producers in the world, comes from illegal sources.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3.Recycle paper and cardboard</h3>
                <p>Did you know that one ton (2,000 pounds) of paper put to recycle prevents the cutting of 17 trees? These 17 trees then sequester around 250 pounds of carbon dioxide from the air every single year .</p>
                <p>If just 10 percent of all the paper used by the average American in one year were recycled, 25 million trees would be saved [11]. That makes 367 million pounds of carbon dioxide absorbed by these trees in one year.</p>
                <p>This means that even by recycling just one paper item out of 10, you are making a difference.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>4.Use recycled products</h3>
                <p>You may have noticed a little label “made from recycled paper” on your new notebook. The same label can be found on many other daily use items like books, paper bags, egg packaging and even toilet paper.</p>
                <p>By choosing items made from recycled paper, you make a conscious effort to lower the demand for more timber.</p>
                <p>Besides decreasing the need to cut more trees, your purchase is also supporting paper recycling facilities and reducing the amount of waste entering landfills. Therefore, try to purchase your next notebook made from recycled paper and the environment will be very thankful.</p>
                <p>The same rule goes for furniture shopping. When buying a new piece of furniture, try to look first for already used pieces. You can often find real treasures for almost no cost. All they need is just a little bit of refurbishing. But this way you can obtain truly unique and personalized pieces for your interior.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>5.Don’t buy products containing palm oil</h3>
                <p>While a small amount of palm oil may be sustainably produced, the majority comes from recently cleared land. Palm oil production has become one of the main causes of tropical rainforest destruction around the world today.</p>
                <p>A large percentage of the world’s palm oil production comes from Indonesia and Malaysia, where the virgin rainforest is being cleared at an alarming rate of 2.4 million acres a year to make way for new plantations.</p>
                <p>Avoiding products containing palm oil might not be easy, because it can be disguised in many different forms in numerous beauty products and food. If you cannot drop some of your favorite products with palm oil entirely, look at least for an alternative that carries a sustainable palm oil certification.</p>
                <p>To date, the most rigorous certification process comes from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), where at least 95% of the palm oil is certified in sustainable practices throughout the supply chain.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>6.Reduce meat consumption</h3>
                <p>To produce the same amount of protein from animal agriculture requires much larger areas of land compared to plant-based farming. For example, nearly one third of the ice-free surface of the planet is converted into pasture for our domestic animals and 30 percent of available arable land is used to grow livestock feed rather than food for our direct consumption.</p>
                <p>The global demand for meat keeps constantly rising, but our space to rear livestock does not. That is why animal farming has become one of the leading causes of deforestation in Amazon. Around 70 percent of the Amazon rainforest clearing is done to make way for cattle ranches.</p>
                <p>If you choose to reduce the amount of meat you eat, you will lower the global demand for meat and help prevent further destruction of forests to make way for more livestock. Start slowly by replacing one portion of animal protein a week with a plant-based protein like beans.</p>
                <p>After all, periods of not eating meat have been practiced by our ancestors for thousands of years – be it because of the meat shortage or religious fasting. In a traditional perception, periods of no meat eating have always been connected with the complete purification of the organism.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>7.Practice eco-forestry</h3>
                <p>Eco-forestry is a restorative method of forest management, which is not based on economic productivity. In this practice, certain trees are selectively harvested while causing minimal damage to the rest of the forest.</p>
                <p>The long-term aim of this method is to systematically fell mature trees, while leaving the forest ecosystem relatively unaffected.</p>
                <p>If you own a piece of forest, follow these principles for they will pay you back in the long run more than the profit focused short-term forestry.</p>
